The notebook provides an end-to-end workflow for analyzing historical weather data and building a machine learning model to predict daily maximum temperatures. It covers data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization, with a focus on time-series forecasting.
This notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for analyzing and predicting weather data using machine learning techniques. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Data Collection
Instructions for downloading historical weather data from NOAA's Climate Data Online portal

Recommends starting with data from 1970 for robust analysis

Provides guidance for selecting weather stations (airports preferred) and downloading CSV format

Data Processing
Initial Setup:

Imports key libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

Loads weather data with DATE column as datetime index

Data Cleaning:

Selects core weather metrics (precipitation, temperature, wind speed, fog)

Handles missing values:

Precipitation filled with 0 (assuming no rain)

Temperature and wind speed interpolated

Fog filled with 0 (assuming no fog)

Drops snow-related columns due to low variability in Oakland

Feature Engineering:

Creates temperature range (max - min)

Adds rolling 7-day average temperature

Includes monthly and day-of-year averages

Adds cyclical date features using sine/cosine transformations

Creates target variable (next day's maximum temperature)

Modeling
Uses Random Forest Regressor for prediction

Implements time-series cross-validation (TimeSeriesSplit) for robust evaluation

Calculates Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as primary metric

Includes feature importance analysis

Visualizes actual vs predicted temperatures

Results Analysis
Examines prediction errors (absolute differences)

Identifies top 10 worst predictions

Shows correlation between predictors and target

Visualization
Plots actual vs predicted temperatures over time

Next Steps Suggested
Multi-day forecasting (week-ahead predictions)

Incorporating regional weather station data

Experimenting with advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM)

Adding more derived features

Hyperparameter tuning

Seasonal error analysis

This notebook provides a complete pipeline from data acquisition to predictive modeling, with particular attention to handling time-series weather data appropriately. The methodology could be easily adapted for other locations by modifying the data source.
